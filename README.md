ALX-HIGHER_LEVEL_PROGRAMMING

High-level programming languages are designed to be easier for humans to read and write. They are abstraction layers that simplify the complex process of instructing a computer. Unlike low-level languages, which are more closely related to the hardware and are harder to read and write, high-level languages are closer to human language and more user-friendly. Here are some key aspects of high-level languages:

ABSTRACTION:
High-level languages provide a high level of abstraction from the internal workings of the computer. This means that programmers can focus on solving problems and creating applications without having to worry about the details of the hardware. e.g memory management like in C language

PRODUCTIVITY:
High-level languages promote higher productivity among developers. They come with built-in functions and libraries, allowing programmers to accomplish tasks with fewer lines of code. This leads to faster development and easier maintenance of software applications.
